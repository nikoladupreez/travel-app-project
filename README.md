OnTrack is a travel-blog-platform on which you can keep track of the countries you visited by posting blogs and photo galleries. 

The app includes: 
- Authorization routes: sign up, login, logout
- Nodemailer: to contact the company or to reset/get your login credentials
- About us page
- Profile page: collect countries (add, edit and delete)
- Blog page: write blogs and add photo galleries of each country you visited (add, edit and delete)


In the extended version, the following features will also be added:
-   An interactive worldmap (explore page), where you can click on a country or search for it via a searchbar and get information about this     country and a link to see travelers who also visited this country.
-   An overview of travelers who visited a specific country.
-   You will be able to visit the blog-pages of other travelers to see their adventures, and like their posts.
-   You will be able to follow your favorite travelers to not only keep track of your own journeys, but also theirs.
